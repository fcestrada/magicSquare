# MagicSquare

## Introduction

This program was developed as an exercise for a programming course regarding the [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) technique to find all possible solutions for a [magic square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square).

## Instructions

### Java

This program was developed using the [Java](https://dev.java/) programming language, so the JDK (Java Development Kit) is required. The development and validations were carried out using the 17.0.12 version which can be [downloaded from this link](https://www.oracle.com/mx/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).

### Compilation

To compile this program run the following command:

```shell
$ javac *.java
```

### Execution

To execute this program run the following command:

```shell
$ java MagicSquareApp
```

## Notes

*   This is not a performance-optimized version (and I'm not interested in that at this moment because the goal was only a simple backtracking brute-force algorithm), and for that reason, magic squares greater than 3x3 won't be able to run in a reasonable execution time without improving the algorithm with constraints or changing the algorithm and also using techniques like parallel programming.
